# Embracing Change: Beginning of My Fitness Journey

## The Downfall

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science back in July 2023, filled with hopes of landing a placement like many of my friends did. However, reality hit hard—I didn't secure any placements. It was a blow to my confidence, leaving me feeling lost and directionless. Days turned into a monotonous cycle of inactivity, stuffing food like a garbage dump, leading to weight gain. By the end of September, I had reached 81 Kgs. This might not sound like a lot but keep in mind that my weight was 71Kg at the end of my college career.

Nobody wants their son to waste away and neither did my family. At first they encouraged me to look for work, provide tuitions or at least do something, not just sit around. They tried their best to make me understand. But I was already knee-deep into this constant laziness already. The thing about laziness is, it is addictive. It squeezes your comfort zone day by day and you get used to it. And let's face it, nobody really wants to get out of their comfort zone voluntarily. Nor did I. So, my family resorted to the only method left to them. They started ridiculing me.

## Point of Absolution

Here I was, a 23 year old unemployed guy with a computer science degree. Wasting away days reading fanfictions and spending ungodly hours on youtube and instagram reels. No wonder they started ridiculing me. Here is the thing though, amidst it all, I developed a thick skin, shielding myself from the criticisms that surrounded me. I was Lazy with a capital 'L' and I had embraced my lay self. This was probably the biggest mistake of my life but at that time I was more stupid than I am now. That shield, however, wasn't impervious. Unexpectedly, a comment from my nephew struck a chord. His words about my weight lingered, triggering a moment of self-awareness. Well getting fat-shamed by someoneone 5 years younger than me was bound to trigger something. For once I decided to look at things objectively, and I realized that what he said was true. I was definitely fat. So, now I did not look good either. I decided enough was enough. I need to change and I need to change NOW! It was a turning point.

## The Journey Begins

September 1, 2023, marked the beginning of my transformation. I started running. No stamina, improper form, and carrying extra weight made each step feel like a herculean task. A kilometer seemed like an insurmountable distance, leaving me exhausted and disheartened. Despite the struggle, a glimmer of pride flickered within me—I had taken the first step.

Embarking on this fitness journey felt like diving into an abyss of self-discovery. Each run, though challenging, became a testament to my determination. I pushed through the pain, gradually building stamina and resilience. From a kilometer to two, and eventually more, my strides became a symbol of progress.

## Overcoming Obstacles

The road to transformation was fraught with obstacles. The initial days were the toughest. Doubt and exhaustion often plagued my mind, threatening to derail my newfound commitment. But I refused to succumb. Every setback became a lesson in resilience. I learned to embrace the discomfort, knowing that growth lies beyond comfort zones.

## Celebrating Progress

Small victories fueled my journey. Witnessing improvements, however minor, fueled my motivation. The number on the scale became less significant compared to the strides I made—both physically and mentally. The ridicule turned into cheers as my family noticed the changes, not just in my physique but in my determination and self-discipline.

## The Continuing Odyssey

My fitness journey isn't just about shedding weight—it's a testament to my resilience, perseverance, and the power of self-belief. Each stride forward is a tribute to the person I aspire to become—a healthier, happier, and more determined individual.

Remember, the first step is often the hardest, but it's the catalyst for transformation. Embrace change, be resilient, and celebrate every milestone—no matter how small. Your journey is unique, and every step forward is a victory worth cherishing.
